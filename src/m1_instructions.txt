Ever wanted to practice you penalty kicks but have no one to be the
goalie? Well this is the game for you!

In this game you will be trying to shoot the ball at the robot goalie
in order to score on him by making the ball into the blue goal area.
The robot goalie will try to predict which way the ball is going
and dive in that direction to stop the ball. The goalie will then
look for where the ball ended up and if it is in the goal you will
score a point. If the robot finds the ball outside of the goal then
that is one point for the goalie. The first to get to the score
you entered will win the game. You can also set the difficulty from
1 to 5 which will change the speed of the robot as well as the
accuracy of the robot goalie when it turns to block the ball.
At the end of each round the robot will have the ball in hand and
you can drive it to place the ball wherever you want on the court and
move the robot back to the goal position remotely.

Begin by putting the ball close to the front of the robot. Then press
Close Ball Calibration. Then place the ball at the far end of the
court and press Far Ball Calibration.

After the camera is calibrated you may enter the score you want to
play to and the difficulty from 1 to 5.

When you are ready to play press the Start Game button. Make sure
that the ball is stationary when you begin as well as at the start
each round. After the first round you must press the Next Round
button when the ball is stationary. When the robot goalie is ready
you simply have to roll the ball towards the goal and the robot will
try to block it. Once the robot has picked up the ball, you will
have to drive it to anywhere on the court then lower the arm to
release it. Then drive the robot back to the starting position and
press next round.
